    <p>Most North American hummingbirds migrate southward in fall to spend winter in Mexico, the Caribbean Islands, or Central America.  A few southern South American species also move north to the tropics during the southern winter. A few species are year-round residents of Florida, California, and the far southwestern desert regions of the US.  Among these are Anna's hummingbird, a common resident from southern Arizona and inland California, and the buff-bellied hummingbird, a winter resident from Florida across the Gulf Coast to South Texas. Ruby-throated hummingbirds are common along the Atlantic flyway, and migrate in summer from as far north as Atlantic Canada,  returning to Mexico, South America, southern Texas, and Florida to winter.   During winter in southern Louisiana, black-chinned, buff-bellied, calliope, Allen's, Anna's, ruby-throated, rufous, broad-tailed, and broad-billed hummingbirds are present.</p>

    <p>As calculated by displacement of body size, the rufous hummingbird makes perhaps the longest migratory journey of any bird in the world. At just over 3 in long, rufous birds travel 3,900 miles one-way from Alaska to Mexico in late summer, a distance equal to 78,470,000 body lengths.  By comparison, the 13-inch-long Arctic tern makes a one-way flight of about 11,185 miles, or 51,430,000 body lengths, just 65% of the body displacement during migration by rufous hummingbirds.The northward migration of rufous hummingbirds occurs along the Pacific flyway  and may be time-coordinated with flower and tree-leaf emergence in spring in early March, and also with availability of insects as food.  Arrival at breeding grounds before nectar availability from mature flowers may jeopardize breeding opportunities. </p>
