# HSA-Academies-Coding-II-React-Example-Template

This template is what you'll be using to follow along with all the React examples. Make sure you follow along because after Day 3, you can also use your filled out template as a starting point for your final project! As always, feel free to email us with any questions you have. Happy coding!

Technical notes:
To install the required base packages, run ```npm i```. To install new packages, run ```npm i *packagename* --save```. To launch your website locally, run ```npm run start```.
